# StockQuotes-Project
# CSCI 490 Mobile App

Created a StockQuote Android Application. The app retrieves a current stock quote for the stock symbol inputted
by the user. When rotated, the state is preserved. Error handling has been implemented when an illegal symbol is typed in. The WOW factor is implementing a splash screen.
